If you wish to help develop we have a simple branch hierarchy:

1. main branch (long term stable) - No one should make branches from this branch, or push to this branch
2. developer branch (stable but up-to-date) - No one should make branches from this branch, or push to this branch
3. working branch - This is where you should make your branches from and push to. Code will be tested and merged into 
   the developer branch (and subsequently the main branch) from here.
