# CRITICAL MIGRATION NOTES FOR PYTHON 3.12
# ======================
# 1. NUMPY 2.x BREAKING CHANGES
#    Removed types (search your code for these):
#    - np.int, np.float, np.bool_, np.complex_
#    - np.unicode_, np.object_, np.str_
#    Replace with: int, float, bool, complex, str, or np.int64, np.float64, etc.
# 2. PANDAS 3.0 BREAKING CHANGES
#    - Index.to_list() behavior changed
#    - groupby() operation changes
#    - Categorical dtype handling changes
#    ACTION: Run full DataFrame test suite
# 3. JAX MAJOR UPGRADE (0.4.31 → 0.9.0.1)
#    - Significant API changes likely
#    - jaxoplanet also updated to 0.1.0
#    ACTION: Test all JAX-dependent code thoroughly
# 4. NUMBA & NUMPY 2.4.2
#    - numba 0.64.0 confirmed compatible with numpy 2.4.2
#    - Earlier numba versions (0.61.0) NOT compatible with numpy 2.x
# 5. DYNESTY 3.0 UPGRADE
#    - Major version change from 2.1.5
#    ACTION: Check for parameter/API changes in nested sampling
# 6. IPYTHON CONSTRAINT
#    - Kept at 8.32.0 (8.x series)
#    - Version 9.x breaks PyCharm integration
#    - This is intentional and recommended
# 7. RADVEL COMPATIBILITY
#    - Upgraded from 1.4.11 to 1.5.0
#    - Explicit Python 3.12 support (has 3.12 classifier)
#    - requires_python: >=3.8
#    - Must be installed FIRST, before juliet
#    - No known breaking changes
# 8. PACKAGES WITHOUT EXPLICIT 3.12 CLASSIFIERS
#    These work via requires_python constraints but should be tested:
#    astroplan, astroquery, barycorrpy, batman-package, corner, dynesty, emcee,
#    exotic-ld, gspread, gspread-pandas, gitchangelog, jaxoplanet, kepmodel,
#    pandastable, pandasql, pastasoss, spleaf, starry, tinygp, wget, wpca, xlrd, yagmail
